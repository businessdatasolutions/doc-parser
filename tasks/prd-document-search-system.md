---

## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement

The internal sales department at our engineering company receives frequent requests about custom-built machines installed at client sites. These requests cover maintenance procedures, operation instructions, and spare parts information. Currently, this information is scattered across PDF documents, requiring significant time to locate:

- **Experienced sales agents**: ~30 minutes per request
- **New sales agents**: 2-4 hours per request (without assistance)

This inefficiency impacts customer response times, increases operational costs, and creates knowledge silos that hinder onboarding and scalability.

### Solution Vision

Build an AI-powered document search and retrieval system that enables sales agents to:

1. Quickly find relevant information across all documentation
2. Retrieve precise answers with source document references
3. Respond to customer requests in minutes instead of hours

**Target outcome:** Reduce information retrieval time by 90% (30 minutes â†’ <3 minutes)

### Product Scope

**Phase 1 (This Document):** Document Storage & Search System (PDF Only)
- PDF document ingestion pipeline
- Markdown conversion and summarization
- Elasticsearch-based full-text search (BM25)
- Document retrieval with source references

**Note:** Phase 1 focuses exclusively on PDF documents and uses Elasticsearch for search. Support for Word/Excel formats and advanced semantic search (ELSER) will be considered for future phases.

**Future Phases:**
- Phase 2: Automated request understanding and response generation
- Phase 3: Learning from user feedback and continuous improvement

**Risk 2: Search Quality for Complex Queries**
- **Description:** BM25 keyword search may not handle complex semantic queries as well as vector search
- **Impact:** Medium - affects user experience for natural language queries
- **Mitigation:**
  - Optimize query parsing and analyzers for technical terminology
  - Implement fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
  - Collect user feedback to improve query handling
  - Plan for ELSER semantic search in future phase if needed

**Risk 3: Elasticsearch Cluster Management**
