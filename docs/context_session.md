# Project Context: Document Search & Retrieval System

**Last Updated:** October 3, 2025
**Project Status:** Core Implementation Complete (Tasks 1.0-5.0) - Integration Testing Complete

---

## Project Overview

### Mission
Build an AI-powered document search and retrieval system to help the internal sales department quickly find information about custom-built machines from scattered PDF documentation.

### Problem Being Solved
- **Current State:** Sales agents spend 30 minutes to 4 hours searching through PDF documents to answer customer requests about maintenance, operations, and spare parts
- **Target State:** Agents find accurate information in <3 minutes using AI-powered semantic search
- **Impact:** 90% time reduction = significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction

### Project Approach
**Phase 1 (Current):** Document Storage & Search System (PDF Only)
- Ingest and parse PDF documents
- Convert to markdown and generate summaries
- Store with metadata and vector embeddings
- Enable semantic search and retrieval
- **Note:** Phase 1 focuses exclusively on PDF documents to accelerate delivery

**Phase 2 (Future):** Automated Request Understanding & Response Generation

**Phase 3 (Future):** Learning & Continuous Improvement

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Decisions

**✅ Document Parsing**
- **PDF:** LandingAI ADE SDK (`dpt-2-latest` model) - already validated
- **Rationale:** Focus exclusively on PDF parsing for Phase 1 to accelerate delivery
- **Future:** Word and Excel support deferred to future phases

**✅ Output Format**
- **Decision:** Markdown as normalized format
- **Rationale:** Human-readable, preserves structure, easy to process with LLMs

**✅ Elasticsearch Deployment**
- **Decision:** Self-hosted Elasticsearch cluster (Basic tier - FREE)
- **Version:** Elasticsearch 8.11+ (latest stable)
- **Licensing:** Basic tier is completely free for self-managed deployments
- **Options:**
  1. Self-hosted single node (MVP) ← Start here
  2. Self-hosted cluster (production scale - 3+ nodes)
  3. Elastic Cloud (managed service - if needed later)
- **Rationale:**
  - Leverage existing Elasticsearch experience
  - Basic tier includes all required features (BM25, fuzzy matching, highlighting, aggregations, security)
  - No license costs ($0/month)
  - Can upgrade to Platinum ($125/month/node) for ELSER if semantic search is needed
- **Next Step:** Deploy single-node Elasticsearch 8.11+ for development

**✅ LLM Provider for Summarization**
- **Decision:** Start with **Claude Haiku 3** for development and testing
- **Pricing:** $0.25 input / $1.25 output per MTok
- **Rationale:**
  - Most cost-effective option (68% cheaper than Haiku 3.5)
  - Fast response times (low latency)
  - Good quality for technical document summaries
  - 200K token context window (handles long documents)
  - Perfect for MVP and testing phase
- **Upgrade Path:** Can easily upgrade to Claude Haiku 3.5 if quality needs improvement
  - Same API, just change model parameter
  - Decision based on real-world summary quality evaluation
- **Cost Optimization:**
  - Cache generated summaries in database to avoid re-generation
  - Monitor summary quality with real documents
- **Use Case:** Generate 150-300 word summaries of parsed PDF documents
- **Next Step:** Implement summarization with Claude Haiku 3 (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`)

**✅ Search Technology**
- **Decision:** **Elasticsearch** with BM25 full-text search
- **Rationale:**
  - Reuses existing Elasticsearch implementation patterns
  - No GPU requirements (simpler infrastructure)
  - Excellent for exact matching (part numbers, model names)
  - Proven technology with established best practices
  - Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance
  - Fast indexing and search performance
- **Future Enhancement:** Add ELSER for semantic search if needed
- **Next Step:** Set up Elasticsearch cluster (single node for MVP)

### Scope Decisions

**✅ Phase 1 Scope**
- **In Scope:**
  - PDF document upload, parsing, storage
  - Summarization (optional for MVP)
  - Elasticsearch indexing and BM25 search
  - Full-text search with fuzzy matching

  - Word and Excel document support (deferred to future phases)
  - Semantic/vector search (deferred; ELSER in future)
  - Automated request understanding
  - Automated response generation
  - CRM/email integration
  - Multi-language support

**✅ MVP Features (Must Have)**
- PDF document upload (100MB max)
- PDF parsing with LandingAI (`dpt-2-latest`)
- Elasticsearch indexing with BM25 search
- Full-text search with fuzzy matching and highlighting
- Document retrieval with full content
- Basic admin panel

**✅ Nice-to-Have Features (Should Have)**
- Document summarization
- Search filters (category, date, machine model)
- Specific answer extraction (RAG)
- Document versioning
- Custom Elasticsearch analyzers for technical terms

### Performance Metrics (Actual)

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Document Upload | <5s | <1s | ✅ Excellent |
| PDF Parsing (1 page) | <10s | ~10s | ✅ Good |
| Summarization (1 page) | <5s | ~2s | ✅ Excellent |
| Elasticsearch Indexing | <100ms | ~38ms | ✅ Excellent |
| **Total Processing (1 page)** | <30s | ~12s | ✅ Excellent |
| Search Response Time | <3s | 55ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Search p95 Latency | <3s | <100ms | ✅ Excellent |
| Document Download | <2s | <1s | ✅ Excellent |

### Key Findings & Learnings

**✅ What Works Well:**
1. **Upload & Validation**
   - File type and size validation working perfectly
   - Multipart form-data handling robust
   - Database record creation reliable
   - API key authentication secure

2. **Background Processing**
   - FastAPI BackgroundTasks working correctly
   - Status updates throughout pipeline
   - Error handling captures failures properly
   - Failed documents don't break the system

3. **PDF Parsing (LandingAI)**
   - Excellent markdown conversion quality
   - Preserves tables, headings, lists, logos
   - Anchor IDs for references
   - Image descriptions included

4. **AI Summarization (Claude Haiku 3)**
   - High-quality technical summaries
   - Fast response times (~2s)
   - Cost-effective ($0.0037 per document)
   - 200K context handles long documents

5. **Search Quality**
   - BM25 relevance scoring effective
   - Highlighting helps users find matches
   - Fuzzy matching handles typos
   - Fast response times (<100ms)

6. **API Design**
   - Consistent response formats
   - Proper HTTP status codes (202 Accepted, 404 Not Found)
   - Pagination working smoothly
   - Filtering flexible and powerful

**⚠️ Limitations Discovered:**

1. **LandingAI Constraints**
   - **50-page limit per PDF** (hard limit)
   - **Rate limiting** on API calls (429 errors)
   - **Solution:** Implement chunking for large PDFs or batch processing
   - **Impact:** Cannot process large technical manuals in one call

2. **Page Marker Detection**
   - Some PDFs don't have clear page boundaries in markdown
   - System treats entire document as single page
   - **Solution:** Improve page detection heuristics

3. **Part Number Extraction**
   - Pattern matching finds some false positives
   - Example: Extracted "bbdf-4195" from anchor ID, not actual part number
   - **Solution:** Refine regex patterns or use ML-based NER

**💡 Recommendations:**

1. **Large PDF Handling**
   - Implement PDF splitting before parsing (max 50 pages per chunk)
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff for rate limits
   - Consider alternative parsing for large documents

2. **Processing Optimization**
   - Cache parsed results to avoid re-parsing on retry
   - Implement queue system for high-volume uploads
   - Add processing rate limits per user/API key

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Track LandingAI API errors and rate limits
   - Monitor processing success/failure rates
   - Alert on high failure rates

4. **User Experience**
   - Add progress indicators for long-running processing
   - Provide estimated completion time
   - Email notification when document is ready
